"You my have determined that C = 5 and that B could equal 7, in which case A + D = 7, or B could equal 2, in which case A + D = 8, but added 5, 2, and 7.",
"You my have determined that C = 5 and that B + B could equal 14, in which case A + D = 7, and then added 5, 4, and 7. However, one of the actual values of B must be used.",
"Since the last digit of C + C is 0, the numbers must have a sum of 10, making the value of C = 5. The sum of 5 and 5 brought a 1 into the tens place, so the sum of B and B must be either 2 or 7, such that B + B is 4 or 14. If B + B = 14, then A + D = 7 (after taking away the 1 carried from the ten column), in which case A + B + C + D = 7 + 7 + 5. The sum would be 19."
