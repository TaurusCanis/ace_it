"You may have equated the variable&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;with the value of the two given expressions, but&nbsp;<em>t&nbsp;</em>has a value of 13 only if&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;has a value of -13 (based on the second equation), and that cannot be demonstrated.",

"You may have take the value of <em>t&nbsp;</em>to be the negative of a number that is greater than half of 13, but that would require&nbsp;<em>s&nbsp;</em>to be a number larger than 13, and the value of that variable cannot be found.",
