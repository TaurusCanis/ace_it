"You subtracted the area of the quarter circle from the area of the triangle, but the shaded region has an area based on subtraction in the opposite direction.",
"You may have calculated the area of the circle instead of one quarter, and you subtracted the area from the area of the triangle, but the shaded region has an area based on subtraction in the opposite direction.",
"Since the area of the triangle is 8, one half of the product of the base and height of the triangle is 8. This is an isosceles right triangle, as both legs are radii of a circle, and so each leg must have a length of 4. Half of the product of 4 and 4 is 8. So, the area of the circle is 16π. One quarter of the circle (the section bounded by the two radii) has an area of 4π. So the area of the shaded section is the difference between the area of the quarter of the circle and the area of the triangle.",
"You subtracted the area from the triangle from half of the area of the circle instead of one quarter of the area.",
"You may have used the area of the triangle as the length of the radius when calculating the area, but the radius is based on a right triangle where have of the product of identical leg lengths is 8."
