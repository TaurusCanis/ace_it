question = f"<p>The heights of a maple tree and a cherry tree currently have a ratio of 5:2. If the maple tree grew 20&nbsp;centimeters, and 20 centimeters was cut off the top of the cherry tree, the ratio of their heights would be 3:1. Currently, how much taller is the maple tree than the cherry tree, in centimeters?</p>\n"

"You may have calculated the current height of the cherry tree instead of the difference between the current heights.",
"Since the unknown heights of the trees have a ratio of 5 to 2, let the ratio of the maple tree height to the cherry tree height be \\(\\frac{5x}{2x}\\). Once the ratio changes are as the result of the height changes, the relationship can be written as \\(\\frac{5x+20}{2x-20}=3\\). Through cross-multiplication and simplification, the equation 5<em>x&nbsp;</em>+ 20 = 60<em>x</em>&nbsp;â€“ 60 results. The solution of the equation is 80, and so 3<em>x</em>, the difference in centimeters between the original heights of the trees, is 240.",
